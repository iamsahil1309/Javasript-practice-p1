✅ 1. DOM Manipulation (Frontend)
Used in almost every UI-related project.

document.getElementById, querySelector
Changing text, styles, attributes
Creating/removing elements
Event listeners
📌 Used for: forms, buttons, modals, UI updates, validation…

✅ 2. Events
Everything interactive relies on events:

click, input, submit
addEventListener
Event bubbling / capturing
Debouncing & throttling (very common in production)

✅ 3. Functions and Arrow Functions
Functions are the core of JS.

Callback functions
Arrow functions: () => {}
Higher-order functions (a function receiving/returning function)

✅ 4. Arrays — used everywhere
You use them daily:

map()
filter()
reduce()
forEach()
find()
includes()
📌 Most data from APIs come as arrays.

✅ 5. Objects — foundation of JS
Used for:

data structures
configuration
API responses
storing state
Understanding:

dot/object access
nested objects
destructuring
spreading { ...obj }

✅ 6. Async JavaScript
A huge part of real production apps:

Promises
async / await
fetch API
Handling delays, timeouts, intervals
📌 Without async JS, you cannot work with APIs, databases, servers.

✅ 7. JSON
Every company uses APIs. JSON is the main data format.

Convert JSON to JS object: JSON.parse()
Convert back: JSON.stringify()

✅ 8. Error Handling
Production = your code must never crash.

try / catch
Handling failed API calls
Handling missing data
Browser/network errors

✅ 9. Modules
Used in almost every modern project:

export function fn() {}
import { fn } from "./file.js";
Used in:

React
Node.js
Modern ES6+ apps

✅ 10. setTimeout, setInterval
Used for:

animations
delays
timers
repeated tasks
debouncing/throttling
⚡ BONUS: Concepts companies expect (but not too advanced)
✔ Closures
Used in event handlers, state management, React hooks.

✔ Scope (block, function, global)
Avoid bugs when variables leak.

✔ Spread & Rest operators
const nums = [...arr];
function sum(...args) {}
✔ Template Literals
Cleaner string building.

✔ Basic OOP
Classes are used in many codebases:

class Car {
  drive() {}
}
⭐ If you master the above 10 concepts, you can build:
real frontend apps
real backend (Node.js)
React / Next.js apps
API-based applications
dashboards
company-grade internal tools
These concepts alone cover 80% of real development work.
